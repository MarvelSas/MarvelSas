## üëã Hello, I'm Marcin Kubisiak

### About me

I'm a young person who tries to become a programmer and has a long story with many different programming languages. I decided to focus on JAVA together with Spring boot, because I'm going to be a backend developer. Likewise, I like to see the result of my work, so that's why I'm also having a little bit of experience in Angular. To tell a little bit about my work experience, currently I'm working as a "Senior ERP and Data Management Specialist".

##  üì±My projects

Below I have prepared a list of my projects with a short description for each of them. For more detail, I encourage you to visit their repository, which you can find in the next section.

### ScoutMate
This project was build to support the scout community, which has a lack of good applications. The project was focused on simplifying the most time-consuming processes in the scout community.

### VM-COM
E-commerce is everything today, so to better understand the challenges which are facing developers of this type of application, I have decided to build with my friend an E-commerce application to understand the challenges and technologies needed for E-commerce.

### MyF
MyF is a live chat application based on WebSocket communication. In this project, I focus on understanding how to work with WebSocket and what are the best practices to work with to implement Websocket for applications. (Pending)
